# From-Dirty-Data-to-Predictive-Models
Using the UCI Health Data set, clean the data and train the models to predict whether a patient has heart disease. 
Early detection of heart disease is important because it helps the doctors
and medical professionals come up with the correct treatment plan based off of patient attributes
and decreases risk over time in preventing complications and extending life expectancy. By
training machine learning models, we can predict whether a patient has heart disease or Is at risk
for heart disease in order to enable enhancements in treatments and advance the overall research
linked to heart disease. In this dataset there is a mixture of different types of variables. It records
a patients age, gender, chest pain, blood pressure, major blood vessels, presence of blood
disorders, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate, exercise relative to rest, slope,
resting electrocardiographic results, exercise-induced angina, and the target. The target
represents our predicted attribute where 0 indicates no heart disease while 1 indicates the
presence of heart disease. This is a diverse set of variables that contains categorical, integer and
real data types.
